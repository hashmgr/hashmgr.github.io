# Hello, I'm Mohamed Hashem 

I'm a Full Stack Engineer with 6+ years of experience building production web applications and scalable backend systems.

Over the years, I've worked on real-world products, solved complex engineering problems, and learned that good software is less about clever code and more about clear design, reliability, and long-term maintainability.

I care deeply about writing clean architectures, improving system performance, and building software that teams can confidently grow on.

## What I Do Best

- Design backend systems that remain stable as products scale  
- Build APIs that are predictable, testable, and easy to evolve  
- Turn business requirements into practical engineering solutions  
- Improve performance and reduce technical debt  
- Write code that other engineers enjoy working with

## Engineering Approach

I value simplicity over unnecessary complexity.

My goal is always to design systems that are:

- Easy to understand  
- Easy to maintain  
- Ready to scale  
- Friendly for future engineers  

Because great software is a long-term investment.

## Current Focus

Right now I'm investing deeper in:

- System design  
- Scalable architectures  
- Advanced backend patterns  
- Engineering best practices  

Continuous improvement is part of the craft.
